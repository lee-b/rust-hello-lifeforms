rust-hello-lifeforms
====================

Hello Lifeforms.  A genetic algorithm, written in Rust.

This is just a quick port / rewrite of something I wrote in Python and C++
previously.  The Rust version is VERY basic so far (compared to the Python
version, which evolved a readable string, or the C++ version which evolved
working programs, in a virtual CPU), but I'll probably make it do more
as time goes on.


Building
--------

For a normal build, just run 'cargo build'

For an optimised build, run ./opt_build.sh


Usage
-----

Run target/lforms
